# Bank Intent Detection with LSTM

Welcome to the Bank Intent Detection repository! This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for intent detection in the context of a banking application. The goal is to classify user intents based on textual input to improve customer service and automate responses.

## Project Overview

This project uses LSTM neural networks to classify intents from customer inquiries in the banking sector. The model is trained on a dataset of customer intents and is designed to predict the intent behind a given message.

## Features

- **LSTM Model**: Implements an LSTM network for intent classification.
- **Data Processing**: Includes data preprocessing steps such as tokenization and padding.
- **Model Training**: Demonstrates how to train an LSTM model using the prepared dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics for evaluating model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes customer queries labeled with various intents. If you have your own dataset, you can replace the existing one or modify the preprocessing steps accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bank Intent Detection project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SakshiFadnavis2003/Bank-Intent-Detection-LSTM.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Bank-Intent-Detection-LSTM
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `Bank_Intent_Detection_LSTM.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any compatible IDE.

5. **Train the Model**:
   Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.

## Usage

After training the model, you can use it to predict the intent of new customer messages. Update the `predict_intent` function with your own text input to get predictions.
